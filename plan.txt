Conditional flow
Name an oracle and send them a link with the verification hex 
On click the escrow meets conditions
Need a page to finish the ecsrow? Why not

Demo flow
Upload PDF -> breakdown to values
Prompted for addresses -> create the escrow txn, return two links: one for validation, one for reference

Validation page -> one click validate, posted to blockchain (fake auth? or fake send via email/phone?)
Reference page -> fetch transaction from blockchain and display in readable format. Finish button exists here. On click, post to the endpoint to finish, then refresh and rerequest data


Endpoints:

1. Derive values
 - IN: File
 - OUT: 3 parties, amount, timeline, condition

2. Create escrow (store conditional map)
 - IN: addresses
 - OUT: Transaction metadata, link to validate, link to reference

3. Validate
 - IN: get request with txn alias as url param, makes the fulfillment available for finish
 - OUT: success flag

4. Reference
 - IN: get transaction addr or mapped alias
 - OUT: json with all data about transaction

5. Finish
 - IN: empty get request, checks that alias has been validated
 - OUT: success or fail flag
